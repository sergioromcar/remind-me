# remind-me

A command-line reminder tool that supports natural language dates and times, inspired by Slack's `/remind` feature.

```
$ remind me to go outside for some fresh air in five minutes
# Ok, I'll remind you to "go outside for some fresh air" on Sunday, September 20 at 4:05 pm
```

## Installation

This module uses some newer JavaScript features, so you'll need iojs or node >=4 installed to use it.

It has been tested on Mac OS X Yosemite, but should work on any system with `cron` support.

```sh
npm i -g remind-me && remind
```

## Usage

#### $ remind me

Create a reminder.

```
remind me in two hours to take a break
remind me to do some deep breathing in 10 minutes
remind me at 3pm to wash the dishes
remind me to wash the dishes at 4:00 pm tomorrow
remind me to get out of bed tomorrow
remind me to put on pants at 8:36 am tomorrow
remind me on friday at 9pm to go party
remind me on February 2 at 6:30am to look for my shadow
```

## Notifiers

The following notifiers are supported. To enable or disable any of them, type `remind config`.

#### `say`

The Mac OS X [say](http://www.maclife.com/article/columns/terminal_101_making_your_mac_talk_%E2%80%9Csay%E2%80%9D) command is enabled by default. This reads your reminder aloud in a computer voice. You can customize the voice. The full list is available by typing `say -v "?"` in your terminal.

Enabled by default.

#### Desktop Notifications

This display reminders using your OS's built-in notification system. This notifier uses the popular and well-maintained [node-notifier](https://github.com/mikaelbr/node-notifier#readme) module.

Enabled by default.

#### Text Messages with Twilio

Send reminders to your phone as text messages using Twilio. You can sign up for a free account which will work but prepends a nag message to all your texts, or you can pay for texts for a nominal fee. To find your Twilio phone number, visit  https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming. To find your Twilio SID and token, visit https://www.twilio.com/user/account/settings
